## Setup

First, you will need Python installed locally and VSCode, PyCharm or your own choice as IDE

```bash
# Prepare Python venv and install dependencies
make install
```

### Running tests

```bash
# To run them once
make test 
# To trigger the tests everytime we make a change in the code
make test-watch
```
